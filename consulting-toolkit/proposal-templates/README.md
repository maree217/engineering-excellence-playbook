## How to Use These Templates

### Template Format
These templates use **POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language)** format:
- Variables marked with `{{variable_name}}` should be customized
- Context sections provide AI guidance for proposal generation
- Output format defines the expected proposal structure

### Customization Process

1. **Gather Client Information**
   - Use [Strategy Workshop](../sales-materials/strategy-workshop-agenda.md) to collect requirements
   - Complete [AI Maturity Assessment](../assessment-tools/ai-maturity-assessment.md)
   - Document specific pain points and priorities

2. **Select Appropriate Level**
   - **Level 1**: Client needs quick wins, limited AI experience, budget < £75K
   - **Level 2**: Client has data foundation, wants intelligence, budget £100-250K
   - **Level 3**: Client ready for transformation, strategic investment, budget > £200K

3. **Customize Template**
   - Fill in client-specific variables
   - Reference industry-relevant case studies from `../case-studies/`
   - Include ROI calculations from workshop

4. **Generate Proposal**
   - Use Claude or GPT to generate proposal from POML template
   - Review and refine for client-specific context
   - Add visual elements and branding

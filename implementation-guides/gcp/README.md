# GCP Implementation Guide

## Coming Soon

Google Cloud Platform-specific implementation guides are currently in development.

### Planned Content:

- **GCP Landing Zone** (Organization + Folders + Projects structure)
- **AI/ML on GCP** (Vertex AI, AutoML, Cloud TPUs)
- **Data Platform on GCP** (BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc, Pub/Sub)
- **Kubernetes on GCP** (GKE, Cloud Run, Anthos)
- **Security & Compliance** (Security Command Center, Cloud IAM)

### In the Meantime:

For platform-agnostic patterns that work on GCP, see:
- [Architecture Principles](../../principles/)
- [Azure vs AWS vs GCP Comparison](../../decision-frameworks/platform-selection/azure-vs-aws-vs-gcp.md)
- [Multi-Cloud Patterns](../hybrid-multi-cloud/)

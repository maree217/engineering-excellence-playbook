# AWS Implementation Guide

## Coming Soon

AWS-specific implementation guides are currently in development.

### Planned Content:

- **AWS Landing Zone** (Control Tower + AWS Organizations)
- **AI/ML on AWS** (Bedrock, SageMaker, Comprehend)
- **Data Platform on AWS** (Redshift, Glue, Athena, EMR)
- **Microservices on AWS** (EKS, ECS, Lambda, API Gateway)
- **Security & Compliance** (AWS Security Hub, GuardDuty, IAM)

### In the Meantime:

For platform-agnostic patterns that work on AWS, see:
- [Architecture Principles](../../principles/)
- [Azure vs AWS vs GCP Comparison](../../decision-frameworks/platform-selection/azure-vs-aws-vs-gcp.md)
